# Q
I'm interested in asking you questions about the feasability of some ideas for expansions to this repo rather than actually implementing any of those ideas for now. 

I'd like to scrape wikipedia data in a manner that respects the graph-relational structure between pages using the links from one to another to create a dataset where documents are connected in a DAG. For example, if we choose the JSON option then rather than grabbing raw text I'd want every link to reference another document in the dataset, maybe with syntax similar to a markdown link such as [referrenced document](ID of referenced document). I imagine rather than grabbing each document at random or in whatever order they're provided by default, we'd have to search out the referenced document and preferrably have it be entered next in the JSON file. And this is for use in training an LLM, so we'll also want to limit how deep we take the graph and whether we do breadth-first or depth-first search or random. 

Please feel free to ask questions about my idea to clarify it rather than immediately jumping to answering my question below if you feel necessary.

Does this repository look like an easy starting point for my idea? If so, would it make more sense to directly edit this repo, or just use it as a reference while starting from scratch? Does it seem like a large or small job (estimate % of files or lines that could be kept/changed)
# A
Based on the code I've reviewed, I think this repository could serve as a reasonable starting point for your graph-based Wikipedia extraction idea. Let me break down what's already there and what you'd need to modify.
Current Capabilities
The WikiExtractor repository provides:
Extraction of text from Wikipedia dumps
Cleaning of Wikipedia markup
JSON output option with document IDs, URLs, and titles
A --links option to preserve links in the output
Parallel processing capabilities
What You'd Need to Add/Modify
Link Preservation and Transformation: The codebase already has a keepLinks parameter (enabled with --links), but you'd need to modify how links are processed to reference document IDs instead of URLs.
Graph Traversal Logic: This is entirely missing. You'd need to add:
Logic to track which pages reference which
BFS/DFS/random traversal algorithms
Depth limiting mechanism
Document Ordering: You'd need to modify the extraction flow to follow the graph structure rather than extracting pages in the order they appear in the dump.
Queuing System: You'd likely need a more sophisticated queuing system to track which pages to process next based on your traversal strategy.
Feasibility Assessment
This appears to be a moderate-sized project. You could keep much of the core extraction and cleaning logic but would need to significantly modify the orchestration of how pages are processed.
The main files you'd need to modify would be:
WikiExtractor.py: The main orchestration logic
extract.py: Specifically the link handling portions
I'd estimate you could keep about 60-70% of the existing code, with modifications needed for:
The link processing functions (like replaceInternalLinks and makeInternalLink)
The document output structure
The overall processing flow
Recommendation
Rather than starting from scratch, I'd recommend using this as a base because:
The Wikipedia markup parsing is complex and already well-handled here
The template expansion system is quite sophisticated
The multiprocessing framework is already set up
However, you would need to fundamentally change how the extraction process works from a linear process to a graph-based traversal.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this analysis or discuss potential implementation approaches for the graph traversal logic?
# Q
Yeah could you provide me with some guidance on how I'd go about making these changes? I'm wondering if we can assume that the files we'd be looking for are definitely in the dump. Also thinking it'd probably be best to stick with links instead of ID numbers that way we might even be able to do separate processing stages where on the first we just get all the data and on the second we search to create graphs, where each time we do the search we could use different hyper-parameters (such as depth or search method) to create different datasets that may conform better to things like the model training run's desired batch size
# A
Implementation Guidance: Two-Stage Approach
You've suggested a smart approach with separate processing stages, which I think is exactly the right way to go. Let me outline how you could implement this:
Stage 1: Enhanced Data Extraction
First, modify the WikiExtractor to preserve links in a machine-readable format:
Modify Link Preservation:
```
# In extract.py, modify the makeInternalLink function
def makeInternalLink(title, label):
    if keepLinks:
        # Change from HTML links to a custom format for easier post-processing
        # Example: [[title|label]] or [[title]] if title == label
        if label == title:
            return '[[%s]]' % title
        else:
            return '[[%s|%s]]' % (title, label)
    else:
        return label
```
Add Link Metadata to JSON Output:
You'll need to modify the JSON output format to capture both outgoing and incoming links. In the extract method:
```
def extract(self, out, html_safe=True):
    # ... (existing code)
    
    # Extract links from the text if keepLinks is enabled
    outgoing_links = []
    if self.keepLinks:
        # Use regex to extract all [[title|label]] or [[title]] patterns
        link_pattern = re.compile(r'\[\[(.*?)(?:\|(.*?))?\]\]')
        for match in link_pattern.finditer("\n".join(text)):
            link_parts = match.groups()
            target = link_parts[0]
            outgoing_links.append(target)
    
    if self.to_json:
        json_data = {
            'id': self.id,
            'revid': self.revid,
            'url': self.url,
            'title': self.title,
            'text': "\n".join(text),
            'outgoing_links': outgoing_links  # Add the outgoing links
        }
        # ... (rest of the existing code)
```
Update Command Line Arguments:
Add a new option to the WikiExtractor.py's parser to enable this enhanced extraction mode:
```
def extract(self, out, html_safe=True):
    # ... (existing code)
    
    # Extract links from the text if keepLinks is enabled
    outgoing_links = []
    if self.keepLinks:
        # Use regex to extract all [[title|label]] or [[title]] patterns
        link_pattern = re.compile(r'\[\[(.*?)(?:\|(.*?))?\]\]')
        for match in link_pattern.finditer("\n".join(text)):
            link_parts = match.groups()
            target = link_parts[0]
            outgoing_links.append(target)
    
    if self.to_json:
        json_data = {
            'id': self.id,
            'revid': self.revid,
            'url': self.url,
            'title': self.title,
            'text': "\n".join(text),
            'outgoing_links': outgoing_links  # Add the outgoing links
        }
        # ... (rest of the existing code)
```
Stage 2: Graph Construction Tool
Create a new Python script that:
Reads the JSON from Stage 1:
```
parser.add_argument('--graph-ready', action='store_true',
                   help='prepare output for graph processing (implies --links and --json)')
```
Builds an adjacency list for the graph:
```
def load_documents(json_file):
    documents = {}
    with open(json_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            doc = json.loads(line)
            documents[doc['title']] = doc
    return documents
```
Implements different traversal strategies:
```
def build_graph(documents):
    graph = {}
    for title, doc in documents.items():
        graph[title] = {
            'id': doc['id'],
            'outgoing': [link for link in doc['outgoing_links'] if link in documents]
        }
    return graph
```
Creates a new JSON file with documents in traversal order:
```
def bfs_traversal(graph, start_node, max_depth=3):
    visited = []
    queue = [(start_node, 0)]  # (node, depth)
    
    while queue:
        node, depth = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited and depth <= max_depth:
            visited.append(node)
            if depth < max_depth:
                for neighbor in graph[node]['outgoing']:
                    queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))
    
    return visited

def dfs_traversal(graph, start_node, max_depth=3):
    visited = []
    
    def dfs(node, depth):
        if node not in visited and depth <= max_depth:
            visited.append(node)
            if depth < max_depth:
                for neighbor in graph[node]['outgoing']:
                    dfs(neighbor, depth + 1)
    
    dfs(start_node, 0)
    return visited

def random_traversal(graph, start_node, max_nodes=1000):
    visited = [start_node]
    current = start_node
    
    while len(visited) < max_nodes:
        if not graph[current]['outgoing']:
            break
        
        next_node = random.choice(graph[current]['outgoing'])
        if next_node not in visited:
            visited.append(next_node)
        current = next_node
    
    return visited
```
Benefits of This Approach
Flexibility: You can create multiple different graph datasets from a single extraction run
Efficiency: You only need to parse the Wikipedia dump once
Adaptability: Easy to experiment with different traversal algorithms and parameters
Robustness: Can handle missing pages by simply skipping links that don't resolve
Handling Missing Pages
With this two-stage approach, you can simply filter out links to pages that don't exist in your dump during graph construction. The build_graph function already does this with:
```
def create_traversal_dataset(documents, traversal_order, output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        for title in traversal_order:
            f.write(json.dumps(documents[title]) + '\n')
```
Customization for Batch Size
For optimizing batch sizes for model training, you could:
Add a parameter to split the output into multiple files of approximately equal size:
```
'outgoing': [link for link in doc['outgoing_links'] if link in documents]
```
Add options to preserve the graph structure within each batch:
```
def create_traversal_dataset(documents, traversal_order, output_prefix, docs_per_file=1000):
    file_count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(traversal_order), docs_per_file):
        batch = traversal_order[i:i+docs_per_file]
        with open(f"{output_prefix}_{file_count}.json", 'w') as f:
            for title in batch:
                f.write(json.dumps(documents[title]) + '\n')
        file_count += 1
```
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation plan or provide additional code examples for a particular aspect?
# Q
Yeah quick sidenote, I'm curious about the size this dataset will end up being. If I download a current wikipedia dump (19GB in size compressed, 86GB uncompressed) then how many tokens would you estimate that at? My goal is 10B, since I could be wrong but I think that's a reasonable amount to be able to both afford on an amateur's budget training a GPT2-small sized model while still getting useable results out of it if the effect size is large enough.
# A
Wikipedia Dump Size Estimation
Based on the dump sizes you mentioned (19GB compressed, 86GB uncompressed), I can provide you with a token count estimate for your GPT-2 training purposes.
Token Count Estimation
Wikipedia dumps contain a mix of actual content, XML markup, templates, and metadata. Here's how the numbers roughly break down:
Raw Text Extraction Rate:
Typically, only about 40-50% of the raw dump becomes usable text after extraction
Using WikiExtractor, this percentage could be even lower depending on your settings
Token-to-Character Ratio:
For GPT-2's tokenizer, 1 token is roughly equivalent to 4-5 characters in English text
This varies by language (e.g., Chinese would have fewer tokens per byte)
Calculation:
86GB uncompressed ≈ 86 billion bytes
Extractable text: ~45% × 86 billion ≈ 38.7 billion characters
Token estimate: 38.7 billion characters ÷ 4 characters/token ≈ 9.7 billion tokens
So you're looking at approximately 8-10 billion tokens from a full English Wikipedia dump, which aligns perfectly with your 10B token goal!
Considerations for Your Project
Training Budget Fit:
10B tokens is indeed a reasonable corpus size for training a GPT-2 small model (124M parameters)
This should be within an amateur budget using consumer GPUs
Graph Structure Impact:
Your graph approach might reduce the total token count if you limit depth
If you use BFS with a shallow depth from popular articles, you might end up with significantly fewer tokens
Flexibility Options:
You could adjust your graph traversal parameters to target specific token counts
Add "walk continuation" logic to ensure you collect enough tokens
Multiple Languages:
If you include non-English wikis, your token count will vary based on language
Some languages are more token-efficient than others when using a GPT-2 tokenizer
Would you like me to discuss strategies for ensuring you get your target token count using the graph-based approach? For example, I could outline methods to dynamically adjust traversal depth based on collected token counts.
